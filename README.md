Neural Pepe is an NFT art collectible project based on Binance Smart Chain and the first project in the Neural Meme family. It consists of 7,777 unique tokenized images of Pepe the Frog generated with a neural network. By holding a Neural Pepe, you accumulate k̶e̶k̶s̶ the AI token on a daily basis, which allows you to choose a name for your Pepe and vote for the next Neural Meme collection.

Neural Pepes were generated using the StyleGAN2 generative adversarial network. The dataset consisted of over 7,000 different Pepe the Frog arts. The final collection includes models of different iterations to make the result more diverse. Each Neural Pepe NFT has a set of traits of different rarity. All traits were assigned using custom-made classifiers and then double-checked manually..
